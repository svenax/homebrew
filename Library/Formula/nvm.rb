      Add the following to $HOME/.bashrc, $HOME/.zshrc, or your shell's
      equivalent configuration file:

        source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh

      Node installs will be lost upon upgrading nvm. Add the following above
      the source line to move install location and prevent this:

        export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm

      You may need to `mkdir ~/.nvm` for that to work successfully.

      Type `nvm help` for further information.
